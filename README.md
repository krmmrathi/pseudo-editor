Pseudo Editor is my attempt to create a WYSIWYG editor using react,ace-editor and material ui. The app allows to write html/javascript code and see the results of the code on the right. The app also features a dark mode, and a download option(download your code as a text file). To run the application:
1. Clone the repo
2. npm install
3. npm start
